# TrueJ
The TrueJ language applies the Variable-Value approach, but attempts to stay as much like Java as is
feasible.

The best place to get a feel for the language is currently the Cucumber readable specifications at
the file TrueJ/Cucumber/Features/aa_valueNames.feature. The [latest results of testing against the
specifications](https://Variable-Value.github.io) are less convenient for reading.
