Outstanding Tasks for examples of T programming
        * means NEED TO DO
        - means DONE

- Check if it is Error or Exception that allows a message
- rewrite for Only adding predicated Java
- code Compound class
- add tests
* recode with SolvationPlan that takes a stock sol and a desired sol and gives 
  stock vol needed, distilled water needed, and NaCl needed to make isotonic with blood
  * first code test copying "phenylephrine hydrochloride results" test from Solution
* recode Solution class for use with SolvationPlan
* translate all classes to Java code
    * all variables are blocking to ensure use of formulas in proofs
    * all imports automatically allow access to the constants of the imported class
    * constraints are checked to find SAT when true and not when false
    * boolean is checked by SAT to find true example and false example 
      within constraints
    * Preconditions are checked for consistency, Pre -> Post is checked 
      for consistency with constraints
    * each fn and procedure is checked for correctness
    *  = constraints are cascaded to all other linear components
    * floats have a tolerance component that is only used in comparisons
    * everytime there is an assigment to a component, all the constraints 
      are checked/calculated
      Of course underspecification is OK, the rest of the constraint is just 
      skipped
* translate all classes to Naked Objects
* use Intervals for float
* Add meas and count with dimensionality
* allow powers of units (mass^2).per(mol), represent as prime integers?
* code for Java with threads
